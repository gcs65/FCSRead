# FCSRead
Flow cytometry describes a process whereby single biological cells stained with
fluorescent dyes pass rapidly in single file through one or more focused laser
beams. Scattered light and one or more fluorescence detectors capture signals from
each cell and store the data as the equivalent of a row in a spreadsheet. Hundreds
of thousands of these rows make up a Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) file ready
for analysis. These files are commonly called list mode files.
The FCSRead app reads FCS3.0 and FCS3.1 list mode files and displays univariate
and bivariate histograms chosen by the user. Gates can be set on peaks in the histograms
and the list mode data gated to show correlations among the peaks in the
histograms. Gate types include rectangular, elliptical, polygon, and quadrants.
